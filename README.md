# üí´ About Me:
I recently completed a comprehensive front-end development course <br>and am eager to further expand my skills by delving into back-end development.<br> Currently, I'm honing my abilities in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, <br>while also laying the groundwork for learning back-end technologies like Node.js.<br>I'm currently working on personal projects to strengthen my understanding of front-end concepts and to apply my newfound skills in real-world scenarios. Additionally, I'm actively seeking opportunities to collaborate with other developers on exciting projects that challenge and inspire me.<br><br>I'm looking to collaborate on projects that involve creating visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces, as well as those that require integrating front-end and back-end functionalities to deliver seamless user experiences.<br><br>While I'm confident in my front-end skills, I'm seeking help and mentorship from experienced developers as I venture into the realm of back-end development. I'm eager to learn best practices, refine my coding techniques, and gain valuable insights from those who have navigated similar paths before me.<br><br>Currently, I'm dedicating time to learning more about back-end development, particularly focusing on technologies like Node.js and Express.js. I'm also exploring additional tools and frameworks that can enhance my development capabilities and broaden my skill set.<br><br>Feel free to ask me about front-end development techniques, best practices for building responsive websites, or tips for optimizing website performance. I'm always eager to share knowledge and exchange ideas with fellow developers.<br><br>Fun fact: Outside of coding, I'm deeply involved in enriching my children's lives. I enjoy actively engaging in their growth and development, whether it's encouraging their creativity through art projects, or taking them on cultural outings to museums, theaters, and other enriching experiences. Being a supportive parent is not only a joy but also an essential part of my life's fulfillment.
