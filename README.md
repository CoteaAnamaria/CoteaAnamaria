# üí´ About Me:
I recently completed a comprehensive front-end development course and am eager to expand my skills into back-end development. Currently honing abilities in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, while laying the groundwork for Node.js. Actively working on personal projects to solidify front-end concepts and collaborate with developers on challenging projects. Seeking mentorship to excel in back-end development, focusing on Node.js and Express.js. Dedicated to enhancing development capabilities and eager to share knowledge with fellow developers.
